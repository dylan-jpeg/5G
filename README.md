5G
5G is the fifth generation cellular network technology. The industry association 3GPP defines any system using "5G NR" (5G New Radio) software as "5G", a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Others may reserve the term for systems that meet the requirements of the ITU IMT-2020. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.[1] It follows 2G, 3G and 4G and their respective associated technologies (such as GSM, UMTS, LTE, LTE Advanced Pro and others).

The development of the technology has stoked fear that 5G radiation could have adverse health effects.[139] Wired characterized fears that the technology could cause cancer, infertility, autism, Alzheimer’s, and mysterious bird deaths as "conspiracy theory".[140] In April 2019, the city of Brussels in Belgium blocked a 5G trial because of radiation laws.[141] In Geneva, Switzerland, a planned upgrade to 5G was stopped for the same reason.[142] The Swiss Telecommunications Association (ASUT) has said that studies have been unable to show that 5G frequencies have any health impact.[143]

Health concerns related to radiation from cell phone towers and cell phones are not new. Although electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not scientifically recognised, effects such as headaches and neurasthenia has been claimed from 4G and Wi-Fi.[144] 5G technology presents a couple of new issues which depart from 4G technology, higher microwave frequencies from 2.6 GHz to 28 GHz, compared to 700–2500 MHz typically used by 4G. Because the higher millimeter wave used in 5G do not easily penetrate objects, this requires the installation of antennas every few hundred meters, which has sparked concern among the public.[139]

Critics of 5G say that these millimeter wave frequencies used by 5G have not been extensively tested on the general public; most experts believe that more scientific research is needed,[145] even as millimeter wave technology has been used in technology such as radar for many decades.[146][147][148] United States Senator Richard Blumenthal in 2018 said "I know of no reliable studies — classified or otherwise that have been done about 5G technology. There may have been studies by the military but so far as I know they failed to meet the specifications that are required in terms of the numbers of animals or other ways of measuring that would be required."[149]

In 2018, RT America, a media outlet funded by the Russian government,[150][151][152] began airing programming linking 5G to harmful health effects without scientific support. The frequency of similar programming increased in 2019. Several RT stories have warned of health impacts such as "brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer’s disease" and have spread to hundreds of blogs and websites.[153]

In January 2019, over 180 scientists and doctors from 36 countries sent a letter to officials of the European Union demanding a moratorium on 5G coverage in Europe until potential hazards for human health have been fully investigated.[154] According to the "Statement on emerging health and environmental issues (2018)" edited by European Commission's Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER), "5G networks will soon be rolled out for mobile phone and smart device users. How exposure to electromagnetic fields could affect humans remains a controversial area, and studies have not yielded clear evidence of the impact on mammals, birds or insects. The lack of clear evidence to inform the development of exposure guidelines to 5G technology leaves open the possibility of unintended biological consequences."[155]

In the US, New Hampshire is considering establishing a commission to study the health effects of 5G networks.[citation needed] Several leaders[who?] in Congress have written to the Federal Communications Commission expressing concern about potential health risks.[citation needed] And in Mill Valley, California, the city council blocked the deployment of new 5G wireless cells."[156][157][158][159][160] Similar concerns were raised in Vermont.[161]

Senator Blumenthal in February 2019 questioned 5G industry representatives about health risks and related studies, finding that the industry has not done studies, nor were any ongoing.[162]

In July 2019, the New York Times wrote an article detailing how an influential study from the year 2000[163], which determined that wireless technology carried a high chance of causing negative health effects in humans, made a scientific error by failing to study the protective benefits of human skin.[164] The article claimed that many of the alleged health concerns around 5G and other wireless technologies in humans have not been scientifically proven.[164]

On August 2019, a court in the USA decided that 5G technology will not be deployed without environmental impact and historic preservation reviews.[165]
